# coconutOS - The One and Only True OS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CoconutOS/coconutos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CoconutOS/coconutos)

Welcome to the world of CoconutOS! The linux distribution you didn't ask for, but the one you definitely need! Inspired by the ironically hilarious wisdom of Richie Guix in a YouTube video by "Programmers are also human". The genesis of CoconutOS is a tongue-in-cheek love letter to the quirks and idiosyncrasies of the GNU/Linux community. 

## About CoconutOS

CoconutOS takes the best of GNU/Linux - its flexibility, freedom, and robustness (and sometimes its utter weirdness) and distills it into an OS experience that's unlike anything you've ever seen. We've been told it's for beginners, but we'd like to think it's for those who love a good laugh and a well-functioning system in equal measure.

## Repositories

In this GitHub organization, you'll find all of our most prized CoconutOS treasures:

1. `coconut-mklive`: Our crown jewel, the core OS. You may or may not turn your watch into a web server with it. Results may vary.
2. `coconutos-packages`: Find all the packages you need. Libreoffice? Check. Pacman (no, not the game)? Check.
3. `coconutos-documentation`: Because even with an OS this intuitive, who knows, you might need a little help.

## Contributing

We invite everyone who wishes to witness the beauty of the free software movement to contribute. In this community, there are no checks for errors, no checks for dependencies. Check out our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and don't worry about it too much.

## Installation

The latest stable release of CoconutOS can be found here. But be warned: once you start installing, you go straight through. NO breaks allowed. For detailed instructions, please refer to the [official CoconutOS Installation Guide](https://github.com/CoconutOS/coconutos-documentation/blob/master/Installation.md).

## Support

We're not saying it's a perfect system. So, if you encounter a problem, don't blame Linux, blame GNOME, KDE, X11, GCC, Java... you get the gist. Here's the [official CoconutOS Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/CoconutOS/coconutos-documentation/blob/master/Troubleshooting.md). 

## License

CoconutOS - an embodiment of freedom, just not free beer. All our repos are licensed under the GNU GPL v3.0, unless we felt otherwise. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more details.

## Join Us!

We're a community, and we've got the multiple sound systems to prove it! OSS, PulseAudio, JACK - each one trying to fix the problems of the previous one. Join us, contribute, or just laugh along at the sheer audacity of creating CoconutOS.

Remember, everyone else is wrong, but that's just our personal view on what everyone should use. But hey, what's a bit of effort to try a new OS?

Happy hacking!
